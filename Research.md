My research goals involve creating methods for improving treatment outcomes, predicting disease prognosis, and implementing these methods as clinical decision support systems.

Here is a link to the presentation I gave at AAPM 2015 related to this material: [SlideShare link](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/dkzHQwmlWf5ud0)

##Brachytherapy 

Brachytherapy is a process in which small radioactive seeds are placed 
in close proximity to a tumor. Generally, the procedure is performed on 
patients presenting either breast or prostate cancer, however it is not 
necessarily limited to these applications. Currently there are several 
brachytherapy seeds to choose from on the market, however due to 
transportation and decay time issues, it is advantageous for a country 
to produce their own seeds. To this end, the Korean Atomic Energy 
Research Institute ([KAERI](http://www.kaeri.re.kr:8080/english/)) has 
begun production of a novel seed. Before a seed can be used clinically 
it must have several parameters, known as 
[TG-43](https://www.aapm.org/pubs/reports/rpt_84.pdf) parameters, 
physically measured and computationally simulated using Monte Carlo 
methods. 

I carried out Monte Carlo simulations for the new seed using 
[MCNPX](https://mcnp.lanl.gov/) software, and will soon be physically 
measuring the dosimetry parameters using a custom build PMMA jig and 
EBT3 film. More information on this project can be found at my 
[Brachytherapy Project](http://joelcarlson.github.io/brachytherapy) 
page.
