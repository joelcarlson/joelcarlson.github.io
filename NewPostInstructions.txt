***Always run jekyll with: bundle exec jekyll serve --watch

How to make a new blog post:



paste function into R:

KnitPost <- function(input, base.url = "/") {
    require(knitr)
    opts_knit$set(base.url = base.url)
    fig.path <- paste0("figs/", sub(".Rmd$", "", basename(input)), "/")
    opts_chunk$set(fig.path = fig.path)
    opts_chunk$set(fig.cap = "center")
    render_jekyll()
    knit(input, envir = parent.frame())
}

Run your .Rmd through the function

Rename file to conform to jekyll date convention and put it in _posts folder of website

Add .yaml frontmatter (ie. add (layout: post)) to the top, remove everything else but the title.
In the frontmatter add an excerpt: _____ call

If there are images in the .md:
Go to the figs directory, make a new folder identical to the post name 
(look in the .md file for the location it looks for images)
and add the images in the folder that knitr creates.
