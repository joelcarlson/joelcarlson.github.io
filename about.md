An about page! Soon you will be able to learn all about me here.  Excited? You bet! Or I bet! or both!

For now, here is a link to my github, but there is actually less interesting stuff there than there is here, so I wouldn't bother [github](https://github.com/joelcarlson)


My name is Joel Carlson. I'm an MSc student at Seoul National University in the Biomedical Radiation Science program. Currently, I'm studying monte carlo methods for brachytherapy dosimetry. Outside of dosimetry I am also interested in radiobiology and radiogenomics. Most recently I have been learning to use R for data analysis, and exploring packages such as shiny to move my work online.

The lab I am affiliated with has a website, check it out!: [Radiological Physics Lab](http://rplab.snu.ac.kr/)
