For the past three years I was living in Seoul, South Korea while completing my MSc in Medical Physics. I now live in Palo Alto, CA with my lovely partner Rhia! We used to foster the puppy in the photo, Dada,  but he has since been adopted into a new and loving home.

Hiking, exploring, statistics and programming make me happy!
