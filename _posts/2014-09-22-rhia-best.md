I wonder if Rhia will browse my website a bit if I send it to her.  Well, if she does, perhaps she will find this!

Hi Rhia! I love you!


{% highlight r %}
##here is some code to show some love!
WhoIsBest <- function(person){
        ifelse(person == "Rhia", TRUE, FALSE)
}

WhoIsBest("Rhia")
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## [1] TRUE
{% endhighlight %}


Could someone else be the best?

{% highlight r %}
WhoIsBest("Someone Other Than Rhia")
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
## [1] FALSE
{% endhighlight %}

Well, I suppose that settles it! Rhia is best!
