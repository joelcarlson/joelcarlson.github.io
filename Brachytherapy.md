Brachytherapy is a process in which small radioactive seeds are placed in close proximity to a tumor.  Generally, the procedure is performed on patients presenting either breast or prostate cancer, however it is not necessarily limited to these applications.
Currently there are several brachytherapy seeds to choose from on the market, however due to transportation and decay time issues, it is advantageous for a country to produce their own seeds. To this end, the Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute ([KAERI](http://www.kaeri.re.kr:8080/english/)) has begun production of a novel seed.
Before a seed can be used clinically it must have several parameters, known as [TG-43](https://www.aapm.org/pubs/reports/rpt_84.pdf) parameters, both measured and simulated using Monte Carlo methods.

The Monte Carlo simulations for the seed were carried out using the [MCNPX](https://mcnp.lanl.gov/) software.

This project has been completed in a reproducible fashion.  Check out the [Brachytherapy Reproducible Research](http://joelcarlson.github.io/brachytherapy/2
