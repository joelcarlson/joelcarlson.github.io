***Always run jekyll with: bundle exec jekyll serve --watch

This way it will emulate the github production server**

How to make a new blog post:



paste function into R:

KnitPost <- function(input, base.url = "/") {
    require(knitr)
    opts_knit$set(base.url = base.url)
    fig.path <- paste0("figs/", sub(".Rmd$", "", basename(input)), "/")
    opts_chunk$set(fig.path = fig.path)
    opts_chunk$set(fig.cap = "center")
    render_jekyll()
    knit(input, envir = parent.frame())
}

Run your .Rmd through the function

Rename file to conform to jekyll date convention and put it in _posts folder of website

Add .yaml frontmatter (ie. add (layout: post)) to the top, remove everything else but the title.
In the frontmatter add an excerpt: _____ call

If there are images in the .md:
Go to the figs directory, make a new folder identical to the post name 
(look in the .md file for the location it looks for images)
and add the images in the folder that knitr creates.

It amounts to replacing all instance of $..$ with \\(...\\) for inline or \\[...\\] for equations
